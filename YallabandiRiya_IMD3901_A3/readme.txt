I choose to do a simple two player tic tac toe game. When the users enter in the localhost the first screen that pops up lets them choose if they
Want to play a 2D game or 3D game. Both players must choose the same game format in order for each players actions to be presented/updated. 
If one player chooses 2D and the other chooses 3D, it won’t work. The competitive part of the game is playing Tic Tac Toe together and the collaborative part if being able to change the colours of the board. The players can also change the colour of the board’s grid. In order the place the 
XO counters the players need to left mouse click on the board.

The most challenging part of the project were Creating a 3D version of the game gave me a few errors as well. Connecting both players with each other was also difficult, and connecting them in a way that both player movements are updated, and giving each player their turn without a player
Going twice in a row.

I used the button concept in assignment 2 to help with the counter clicking, and I used lesson 7 to help me with the websocket part
Of the project. Overall the project was fun and I learnt a lot of new things.
